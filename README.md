# SelfSolvingMaze

For right now I'm just going to use this readME as a place to keep my written notes contained in a central location and also this will be an easy way to let others observe my thought process in breaking down this multilayered challenge into programmable logic.

The biggest challenge I am currently facing is comprehending the rotational matrices required to calculate the neccessary servo's rotational positions given the desired position of the platform (inverse kinematics). I'm currently reading a document which I will include a source for here in this readME when everything goes well and I take the opportunity to convert this from notes into a readable guide

Needed Platform Constants:

Physical Constants (information about the dimensions of the build)
Bi = 
Pi =
s  =
a  =
Î²i = 

Servo Constants (information necessary for controlling the servos)
Wi0 =
r   =

(home variables)
h0  =
a0  =

These tech docs are man's greatest attempt at breaking down presumably complex concepts into layman's english so that anyone could understand it, thus transferring ideas from your brain to mine... only thing is reading comprehension is essential in order to mentally digest what is attempting to be conveyed
